            <p>
              Born and raised in Virginia, I am a graduate of George Mason University with a Bachelor's of Science in Public Health. I have worked in a variety of fields, from butcher's assistant to specimen management technician, and I am now pursuing a career in web development. I have always had a passion for building models as a child and as an adult, web development has been a perfect fit for my tendencies of fiddling and fitting various pieces together. After hearing about the GWU Bootcamp from a coworker, I decided to take the leap of faith. I am really enjoying the program and really proud the progress that I have been making having had no prior experience with web development.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              The correlations between web development and my hobbies has been eye opening. I have always had an interest in computers, but my interest had been surface level in terms of hardware,web-surfing, and computer games. My father has always been technologically savvy and wished to impart onto me the knowledge of building a computer. I built my current desktop as a freshman in college and have been upgrading it incrementally throughout the years. As a child I have always enjoyed fiddling with Legos, plastic model kits, and sculpting. Web design take these interests of mine and gives me the freedom to create from start to finish in a way that I find very engaging and satisfying. As a fledgling web developer, I hope to gain all the experience and absorb all the information within the GWU Bootcamp and becoming both competent and proactive in learning and developing.
